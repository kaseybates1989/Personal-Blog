        <p>Oh where to begin... I have been a Registered Nurse going on nine years. Growing up all I ever wanted to do was be a nurse. I thrived in knowing that I could make a difference in someones life. I would lie if I said I never enjoyed being a nurse. I did, I loved it. I loved helping people. I was an emergency room nurse for 6 years when I first got my license. Then I made the move to hospice. Hospice was were my heart was. My love for nursing did not change until the pandemic hit. Nurses became overworked and underpaid. The mind shifted about nursing in the general population and therefore, my mind shifted. All of a sudden, I noticied that I was no longer enjoying my career. It started becoming a chore rather that something I loved to do. I did not want to be unhappy for the rest of my life in my career. I wanted to do something that interests me. I started thinking of other things I could do to support my family besides nursing. My husband was in school to become a full stack engineer. I really enjoyed watching him when he worked on front end development. It caught my attention. So, I started doing some research and here I am. I am now enrolled in a front end development program and builiding and designing my own websites. It is so much fun to me. The options are endless. It brings out my creative side and I <u><strong>love</strong></u> that! I love the satisfaction I get when completing a project. This career change will allow me a better work-life balance. It is something that my husband and I can do together. That excites me the most. I believe that we all go through seasons in our life when one thing works and then the next season it needs to be changed. If it wasn't for my nursing career, I would have never met my husband. I would not have been able to spend countless hours with dying patients and their families. I know that does not sound like something enjoyable but it has made a difference in my life. I have learned so much. I will forever be grateful for my time in nursing. It has set met up for a wonderful future. But, now it is time that I move on to the next season in my life and I could not be more excited. </p>
        <p>**Here is a quote that has helped me through my decision to change careers: <q>The future depends on what you do today.</q></p>
